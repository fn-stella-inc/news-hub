      "excerpt": "Researchers have developed a new error-correction method that brings practical quantum computers closer to reality.",
      "content": "<p>In a groundbreaking development, a team of international researchers has announced a significant advancement in quantum error correction, addressing one of the most challenging obstacles in quantum computing.</p><h2>The Error Correction Challenge</h2><p>Quantum computers are inherently susceptible to errors due to quantum decoherence—the tendency of qubits to lose their quantum properties when interacting with the environment.</p><h2>A New Approach</h2><p>The new technique reduces quantum decoherence by an order of magnitude, allowing quantum bits (qubits) to maintain their states for unprecedented periods. This was achieved through a novel combination of hardware and software innovations.</p><h2>Practical Implications</h2><p>This breakthrough could accelerate the timeline for achieving quantum supremacy in practical applications, from drug discovery to climate modeling.</p>",

      "excerpt": "For the first time, renewable sources generated more electricity than fossil fuels across multiple major economies.",
      "content": "<p>A historic milestone has been achieved as renewable energy sources have surpassed fossil fuels in electricity generation across several major economies simultaneously.</p><h2>Solar and Wind Lead the Charge</h2><p>Solar and wind power led the transition, benefiting from years of investment and technological improvements that have dramatically reduced costs. Grid-scale battery storage has also played a crucial role.</p><h2>Economic Implications</h2><p>The economics of renewable energy have fundamentally shifted. In most markets, new solar and wind installations are now cheaper than operating existing fossil fuel plants.</p><h2>The Path Forward</h2><p>This shift represents a crucial step toward meeting global climate goals and demonstrates the viability of clean energy at scale. However, significant challenges remain in grid modernization and storage.</p>",
